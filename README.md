# Natick Robotics Notebook Archive

Here, a set of python notebooks (jupyter notebooks) can be found involved in solving
various problems related to robotics.

If you solve a hard problem, do your work in here so the future can see it! If you
need help, try digging through this archive, you may find what you're looking for.


## Usage

I recommend opening these in VSCode on a computer with python installed. When you open
one of the `.ipynb` files, VSCode should automatically prompt you to install the necessary
plugins to run the notebooks and make your own.
